# Red Team Tools

<br/>

This repo contains different tools that I have written in Python that perform Red Team functionality. A lot of these tools already exist in some form or another, but I wrote these for the learning experience, and also to potentially look at what AV software would detect this. I **do not** authorize the use of these tools to peform malicious activities, and they should only be tested on personal systems or with the explicit written consent of other system owners.  

*All of the tools are being re-factored to conform to Object-Oriented Programming best practices. The main branch will be updated when the new code is written and tested.*

## Technologies

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Python 2](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to install the latest [Python Interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Next Steps

Navigate to one of the sub-directories to explore the code and see additional instructions on how to use the tools.
